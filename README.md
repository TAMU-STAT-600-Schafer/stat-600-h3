## Multi-class logistic regression

Logistic regression is one of the most popular classifiers. Consider the
training data consisting of $n$ samples $(x_i, y_i)$,
$x_i\in \mathbb{R}^p$, $y_i\in \{0, \dots, K-1\}$ ($K$ classes, the
coding starts from 0). For each class $k\in\{0, \dots, K-1\}$, we
consider class probabilities for sample $i$ conditioning on the
corresponding vector of covariates $x_i$: $$
P(y_i = k|x_i) = p_k(x_i; \beta), \quad \sum_{k=0}^{K-1}p_k(x_i; \beta) = 1.
$$ We assume the following model holds for class probabilities $$
p_k(x_i; \beta) = \frac{e^{x_i^{\top}\beta_k}}{\sum_{l=0}^{K-1}e^{x_i^{\top}\beta_l}}.
$$ Unlike binary case where there is only one $\beta$, we now have $K$
vectors $\beta_k \in \mathbb{R}^p$, $k\in \{0,\dots, K-1\}$, one for
each class. Because of the constraint that class probabilities sum to
one, the above model is over-parametrized (in binary logistic, we had
only one $\beta$ rather than two, as we can always express one
probability as 1 minus all the others). Thus, typical implementations of
multi-class logistic regression pick one of the classes as a reference.
However, the over-parametrization problem is solved by adding ridge
regularization, that is by considering the following objective function
$$
f(\beta) = \left[-\sum_{i=1}^n\left\{\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}1(y_i=k)\log p_{k}(x_i; \beta)\right\} + \frac{\lambda}2\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\sum_{j=1}^p\beta_{k,j}^2\right], \quad \mbox{where} \quad  p_k(x_i; \beta)=\frac{e^{x_i^{\top}\beta_k}}{\sum_{l=0}^{K-1} e^{x_i^{\top}\beta_l}}.
$$ with some $\lambda >0$ over
$\beta = (\beta_0, \dots, \beta_{K-1})\in \mathbb{R}^{p \times K}$. Here
$1(y_i=k)$ is the indicator function, that is it is equal to one when
$y_i=k$ and is equal to zero when $y_i \neq k$. The ridge regularization
makes the solution unique as it essentially looks for $K$ vectors
$\beta_k$ that satisfy the above model **and have the minimal euclidean
norm**.

Thus, the objective function $f(\beta)$ depends on the supplied training
data $X\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$ (with 1st column being all ones to
account for intercept) and $y \in \{0, \dots, K-1\}^n$; and its argument
is matrix
$\beta = (\beta_0, \dots, \beta_{K-1})\in \mathbb{R}^{p \times K}$,
where each column corresponds to specific $\beta_k$.

We find the matrix $\beta$ by minimizing the above $f(\beta)$. Once the
minimizer $\beta^* \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times K}$ is found, the
classification for a new $x\in \mathbb{R}^{p}$ is performed by assigning
$x$ to the class with the largest probability $p_k(x; \beta)$, where $$
p_k(x; \beta) = \frac{e^{x^{\top}\beta^*_k}}{\sum_{l=0}^{K-1}e^{x^{\top}\beta^*_l}}.
$$

## Damped Newton’s method implementation

In this assignment, we will implement Damped Newton’s method to minimize
$f(\beta)$.

Let $P_k = P_k(X; \beta) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be a vector containing class
specific probabilities $p_k(x_i; \beta)$ as defined above. Let
$W_k = W_k(X; \beta)$ be a $n \times n$ diagonal matrix with diagonal
elements $w_{kii}=p_k(x_i; \beta)(1-p_{k}(x_i; \beta))$. There are $K$
total vectors $P_k$, and $K$ total matrices $W_k$. It can be shown that
the Damped Newton’s update with learning rate $\eta >0$ for $f(\beta)$
has the form $$
\beta_k^{(t+1)} = \beta_k^{(t)} - \eta (X^{\top}W_kX + \lambda I)^{-1}\left[X^{\top}\left\{P_k - 1(Y = k) \right\} + \lambda \beta_k^{(t)}\right],\quad k=0,\dots, K-1;
$$ where $1(Y = k)\in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a vector with elements
$1(y_i=k)$. Here both $W_k$ and $P_k$ depend on $\beta^{(t)}$.

**Task 1:** Prove that the formula above for $\beta_k$ update indeed
corresponds to damped Newton’s method for minimizing $f(\beta)$
(e.g. derive gradient and Hessian, and plug in). Upload your derivations
to this repository as a pdf file called **Derivations.pdf**

- You can hand-write, and then transfer to pdf using one of the phone
  scanner apps

**OR**

- If you are familiar with R markdown and prefer to use it, you can
  create **Derivations.Rmd**, and transfer that into pdf; upload both to
  Github

**OR**

- You can use LaTex, and then upload the pdf

## Starter code

**Task 2:** **FunctionsLR.R** contains the wrapper for the following
function

``` r
LRMultiClass(X, y, Xt, yt, numIter, eta, lambda, beta_init)
```

Here `X`, `y` are the training data, and `Xt`, `yt` are the testing
data. This function will first perform some checks on the input
arguments (as specified), then evaluate the objective function/class
assignments at starting point `beta_init`, and then proceed to implement
damped Newton’s update for exactly `numIter` iterations. For simplicity,
we will only run the algorithm for this fixed number of iterations. Note
that the 1st iteration is the 1st time you update the beta and errors
(with iteration 0 being the values at starting point).

Within each iteration, you will update $\beta$ according to the update
above, calculate the objective value at new beta, and calculate
classification error using that beta (in %) on both training and test
data. You are welcome to create as many additional functions as you want
(and put them all within **FunctionsLR.R**), but I will explicitly test
only `LRMultiClass` function for input/output concordance. More
instructions are provided within the comments of the wrapper code. As
with the k-means algorithm, you are not allowed to use any external
libraries.

Things to keep in mind when implementing:

- the number of classes $K$ should be determined based on supplied input

- the class coding goes from $0$ to $K-1$, whereas R matrix/vector
  indexing starts from 1. There are several ways to account for this and
  there is not a single solution here. Also note that you can always
  recode the classes any way you want within the function as long as you
  get correct output (from 0 to $K-1$) on the specified input (from 0 to
  $K-1$).

- the errors are returned as % rather than proportions, which means that
  for 20% error rate the returned number should be 20 (rather than 0.2)

- calculating $(X^{\top}W_kX + \lambda I)^{-1}$ is tricky as the matrix
  $W_k$ may be too large to explicitly store in memory. You should avoid
  storing $W_k$ as a matrix.

- you would not be able to completely eliminate for loops (both because
  of iterations and because of K classes), however you want to avoid for
  loops over samples for class assignments

- you should check your code on simple examples before proceeding to the
  data (i.e. do I calculate objective function correctly? what happens
  if I use two normal populations? does the objective value improve
  across iterations? how does the classification error change across
  iterations?). You will be expected to save your checks in **Tests.R**
  file. I will use automatic tests to check that your code is correct on
  more than just the data example with different combinations of
  parameters.

## Application to Letter data

**Task 3:** You are given two datasets to see the application of your
code:

- **letter-train.txt**, **letter-test.txt** - you will use these data of
  16 features to assign one of the 26 labels (corresponding to different
  letters in the alphabet, comes from images)

- the file **Test_letter.R** contains some code to load the data and
  extract covariates/assignments. You need to complete it with addition
  of intercept columns, run your algorithm and check the performance
  based on provided graphical plots. You will also be asked to time the
  function on your computer (We will redo the timing again but it should
  give you some idea). More comments are provided within the code.

## Grading for this assignment

Your assignment will be graded based on

- derivations of damped Newton’s update *(5% of the grade)*

- correctness *(45% of the grade)*

Take advantage of objective function values over iterations and error
rates as a way to indirectly check the correctness of your function. For
the letter data and default values, I get around 22% error rate on
training data, and around 26% error rate on testing data after 50
iterations.

- speed of implementation (you need to be smart in calculating Hessian
  to pass the requirement) *(30% of the grade)*

My code takes around 4.3 seconds on my Intel chip laptop and 1.4 seconds
on my Apple M1 chip for the letter data with 50 iterations,
$\lambda = 1$ and $\eta = 0.1$. You will get full credit if your code
runs **at most 3 times slower** than mine. You will get +5 **bonus**
points if you’re **completely correct** code on 1st submission is faster
than mine (median your time/median mine time \< 0.9).

- code style/documentation *(10% of the grade)*

You need to comment different parts of the code so it’s clear what they
do, have good indentation, readable code with names that make sense. See
guidelines on R style, and posted grading rubric.

- version control/commit practices *(10% of the grade)*

I expect you to start early on this assignment, and work gradually. You
want to commit often, have logically organized commits with short
description that makes sense. See guidelines on good commit practices,
and posted grading rubric.
